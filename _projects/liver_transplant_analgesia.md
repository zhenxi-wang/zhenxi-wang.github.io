Numerous divergent approaches exist for the management of analgesia following liver transplant procedures. Regrettably, there is a notable absence of established guidelines or standardized care protocols concerning analgesia for pain management in liver transplant patients. This research paper endeavours to address this gap by undertaking a retrospective cohort study involving liver transplant recipients treated at [Flinders Medical Centre](https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/services/hospitals/flinders+medical+centre/flinders+medical+centre) from January 2021 to January 2023. The investigation will comprehensively analyse the utilization of analgesia, encompassing the preoperative phase, hospitalization during the transplant procedure, discharge, and postoperative follow-up. It is anticipated that the outcomes of this study will yield invaluable insights conducive to the formulation of guidelines for current clinical practise.

Background
======
In the year 2021, a total of 253 liver transplant procedures were conducted in Australia. Alarmingly, more than a third of liver transplant (LT) recipients face the risk of opioid abuse, emphasizing the dual nature of prescription opioids as both a potential remedy and a significant detriment. These pharmaceutical agents have now garnered widespread recognition for their capacity to induce substantial morbidity and mortality. Particularly concerning is the prevalence of opioid overprescribing in the post-operative context, a practice associated with considerable harm and mortality. Postoperative patients, especially those undergoing abdominal surgery, are susceptible to opioid-induced ileus.

Despite concerted efforts to curb opioid misuse, opioid prescribing to individuals with cirrhosis remains unacceptably high, owing to several interrelated factors. This persistent trend in opioid prescription for cirrhotic patients has demonstrably led to hospitalization, decompensation, and even mortality. Furthermore, pretransplant opioid usage has been associated with post-transplant opioid dependency, graft loss, and mortality. Consequently, the opioid crisis has engendered a public health emergency that has negatively affected recipients of liver transplants. Recent retrospective investigations have underscored the adverse influence of pre-LT and post-LT opioid consumption on the risk of graft loss and mortality, emphasizing the imperative need for opioid minimization within this high-risk population.

Despite the plethora of studies exploring postoperative multimodal analgesia, there have been limited endeavours to completely avoid opioid usage, with no documented initiatives specifically tailored to LT recipients. Regrettably, there are no widely accessible guidelines to provide direction for clinicians seeking to optimize analgesia in the perioperative and post-discharge phases. However, recent research has yielded encouraging results in reducing opioid consumption among liver transplant recipients in the perioperative period. This was achieved through the implementation of a multimodal pain management order set and a multidisciplinary approach to post-operative opioid use, known as the [Opioid Avoidance Pathway (OAP)](https://journals.lww.com/lt/abstract/2020/10000/opioid_avoidance_in_liver_transplant_recipients_.10.aspx).

The multimodal pain management order set encompassed the administration of gabapentin 300mg thrice daily, adjusted for renal function, acetaminophen 650mg four times a day, and opioids as needed. This approach led to an average reduction of 30.6 milligrams of morphine equivalent (MME) opioid usage per day, compared to a control group utilizing an opioid-only order set. The OAP, on the other hand, involved a non-pharmacological educational intervention provided by the surgeon, pharmacist, and psychologist during the listing process. Additionally, it included a pharmacological strategy similar to the aforementioned multimodal pain management order set, but with additional provisions for sedation using ketamine and dexmedetomidine, incisional pain control through ropivacaine administered via lateral incisional catheters, and the use of tizanidine or baclofen. This comprehensive approach resulted in a remarkable average reduction of 80mg of MME opioid usage per day until discharge, when compared to a historical control group following an opioid-only order set.

This evidence supports the contention that a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach to perioperative analgesia can effectively reduce opioid usage in a population already vulnerable to chronic postsurgical pain. Before incorporating any of these findings into clinical guidelines at the [Liver Transplant Unit](https://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/services/hospitals/flinders+medical+centre/services+and+clinics+at+flinders+medical+centre/services+at+flinders+medical+centre/hepatology+and+liver+transplantation+medicine+services+at+flinders+medical+centre) at Flinders Medical Centre, it is imperative to first characterize the current pain management practices in these patients. Consequently, the primary objective of this project is to comprehensively assess the existing strategies for managing pain in liver transplant patients through a retrospective cohort study.


Objectives
======
*	To establish a comprehensive definition of the analgesic regimens employed in the context of liver transplantation.
*	To elucidate and document the adverse effects associated with the utilization of analgesic treatments subsequent to liver transplantation.
*	To ascertain the adequacy of the analgesic regimens used in the post-liver transplantation period.
*	To undertake a detailed descriptive analysis, aimed at identifying and understanding the various factors correlated with heightened requirements for analgesia.

Expected outcomes
======
Significant variability is evident in the prescription patterns of analgesic medications among liver transplant patients, particularly concerning the choice of drug class, dosing frequency, and quantity which are frequently prescribed during the inpatient phase. Additionally, a substantial proportion of patients either have a documented history of chronic pain or substance abuse or present with liver disease aetiologies such as alcoholic liver disease (ALD) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), necessitating the utilization of opioids, in contrast to patients without these specific conditions.
