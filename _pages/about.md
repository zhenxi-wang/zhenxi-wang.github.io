I am a first-year medical student at [Flinders University](https://www.flinders.edu.au/college-medicine-public-health), South Australia, studying [Bachelor of Clinical Sciences, Doctor of Medicine (M.D.)](https://www.flinders.edu.au/study/courses/bachelor-clinical-sciences-doctor-medicine).

I am fascinated by the dynamic intersections of machine learning within clinical medicine. My current research is mainly focused on transformative realms of medical imaging, deep learning, and precision medicine. I am also interested in other extensive clinical translational research and its applications.

Academic Interests
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Hobbies
======
Acoustic Guitar, Music (I am a big fan of [Stefanie Yanzi Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanie_Sun) and [Faye Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Wong)), Billiards, Basketball, and Photography.
